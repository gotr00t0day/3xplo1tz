A meticulously curated collection of exploitation tools for the discerning security professional.  When precision meets power, and stealth meets sophistication.

### 🎯 Target Spectrum:
- Legacy systems that should've retired during the dot-com bubble
- Modern infrastructure thinking it's too cool for patches
- Everything in between that makes security researchers grin

### 🏆 Features That Would Make Kevin Mitnick Proud:
- More modularity than a LEGO convention
- Cleaner code than your production environment
- Better documentation than your college notes
- Smoother than social engineering the help desk

### 🎮 Capabilities Matrix:
```c
arsenal = {
"recon": "More thorough than your ex's social media stalking",
"exploit": "Smoother than a cat burglar in velvet socks",
"post_ex": "More persistent than your grandmother's Facebook notifications",
"exfil": "Sneakier than office snacks disappearing from the break room"
}
```

### Disclaimer:

Remember: With great exploits comes great responsibility... and incident response tickets.
